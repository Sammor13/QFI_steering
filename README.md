## Abstract
We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 20 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.
